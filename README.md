# RelXTractor

This is a simple relation extraction model that extracts relations from news texts.
1. paste the url links of the news sources to the sources.txt as described
2. run the RelXTractor.exe file
3. the connections.csv file will be updated with the connections
4. the actors.csv file will be updated with the actors

Note: This extraction model is still very naive. It can differentiate between same people called with aliases. The sentiment between relations is limited to the sentiment of the overall sentence that the relation is present in. Further updates will be made to optimise the naivety.
